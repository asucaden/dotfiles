# 🛠️ Caden's Dotfiles

Minimal, carefully-scoped dotfiles setup for portability and repeatable development environments.

Currently includes:

- `.tmux.conf` — ergonomic prefix (`Ctrl-a`), Vim-style pane movement, reduced escape delay
- `nvim/` — full Neovim config (uses LazyVim)
- `install.sh` — safe, versioned symlink installer

---

## 🚀 Installation

Clone and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cadenmidkiff/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
